              Lakshya is an amazing leader. Her leadership style is by doing. She passes on credit when the team wins and owns up the brickbats when something fails.
              In the community space, all the ambassadors contribute to their tech communities during their spare time. And they have no obligation to contribute within deadlines unless they are deeply motivated.
              Lakshya does this by having a one on one relationship with all the ambassadors, empowering them to be leaders and helping them with all the support when needed.

              Doing a task ourselves is often easier than getting it done by a big team, but her patience, planning, execution, comradeship, and ownership of the task at hand are perfect.
              I'm reminded of the analogy of a garland of flowers, the thread doesn't show at all, but it is what pulls all the flowers together.
              Her passion for women in tech, helping them fight bias is incredible.
              Mark my words, she's a great leader in the making.

              It was an honor for me to work with you on SDLP project. Your insights on existing solution really saved us a lot of time. Your effort in arranging KT sessions with members of other teams was fabulous. Your positive attitude towards taking up challenges and delivering before time was the most notable thing. Your efforts to precisely complete the Documentation must not pass unappreciated.
              Wishing you best for future and really looking forward to work with you again.
